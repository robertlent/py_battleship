Python Battlship Game

The player can choose the size of the grid, from 5x5 up to 10x10. The size of the grid also determines the number of turns the user gets, from 5 to 10.

The game handles incorrect entries and the game can be replayed repeatedly, and the ship will be randomly placed on a grid the size of which the player chooses.
