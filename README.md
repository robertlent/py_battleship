# Battleship

Battleship is a Python command line game.

The player can choose the size of the grid, from 5x5 up to 15x15, and the ship will be randomly placed in that grid. The size of the grid also determines the number of turns the user gets, from 5 to 15.

The game handles incorrect entries and can be replayed repeatedly.

### Requirements
The application requires Python 3 be installed on your computer. After downloading and unzipping the files, you can then run the command 'python battleship.py' from inside of the unzipped folder.
